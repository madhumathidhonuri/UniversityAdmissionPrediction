**🎓 University Admission Prediction**
This project analyzes the factors influencing university admissions and builds a machine learning model to predict a student's chance of acceptance.

**📋 Project Overview**
The model uses a dataset (university_admission.csv) containing several student attributes:
  - Pre-Term Test Scores
  - Final-Term Test Scores
  - University Rating
  - Statement of Purpose (SOP) Strength
  - Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Score
  - CGPA
  - Research Experience
The goal is to predict the admission_chance (a value between 0 and 1). The final model is a Linear Regression model that successfully explains 82.1% of the variance in admission chances ($R^2 = 0.8212$).

**⚙️ Dependencies**

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries.
- pandas
- numpy
